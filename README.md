#BLOG SITE WITH COMMENT SECTION
This project is a responsive blog website designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the IBM Naan Mudhalvan Front-End Development course.
The website allows users to read blog posts and interact by adding comments dynamically without any backend database.

It demonstrates the core front-end development skills such as:

Creating web layouts using HTML

Styling and responsiveness using CSS

Adding interactivity and data handling using JavaScript
##Features

🏠 Home Page Layout — Clean and responsive blog interface

🧾 Dynamic Comment Section — Users can add and view comments instantly

💾 Local Storage Integration — Comments persist even after refreshing

📱 Responsive Design — Works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices

🎨 Simple and Modern UI — Neat design using Flexbox and consistent colors

⚙️ Fully Frontend Based — No backend or server required for this project
##How it works
User Interface (HTML + CSS)
The website displays blog posts with a title, author, date, image, and content.
The layout is styled using CSS to make it responsive and visually appealing.

Comment System (JavaScript)

The user enters their name and comment in the input fields.

When the “Post Comment” button is clicked, the comment is added to the list.

The comment is also saved in localStorage to ensure it stays visible after reload.

Data Rendering
On page load, the script reads the saved comments from localStorage and displays them dynamically inside the comment box.

No Server Needed
Since this is a front-end only project, all data is handled within the browser.
##Challenges faced
Managing and displaying multiple comments dynamically using JavaScript

Ensuring comments remain after refreshing (solved using localStorage)

Designing a mobile-friendly layout that adjusts to different screen sizes

Maintaining clean, readable, and structured code for HTML, CSS, and JS

Understanding the integration between different front-end components
